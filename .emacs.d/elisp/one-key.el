;;; Commentary:
;;
;; With so many Emacs extensions, you have a lot of keystrokes to remember, and you probably forget most of them.
;;
;; This package fixes that problem, and helps new users to learn the common keybindings.
;;
;; One Key provides a single keystroke that when pressed presents you with a menu of choices in a popup window
;; for commands to execute with a further keystroke. By default menus for common prefix keys and commands are defined.
;;
;; Just type one of the listed keystrokes to execute the corresponding command.
;;
;; You can delete, edit, sort, highlight and filter the menu items, add new menu items and even add new menus.
;; You can have access to several different menus from the same window which can be navigated with the arrow keys.
;; Such a collection of menus is called a menu set and you can define several different menu sets containing different
;; types of menus.
;; Several different types of menus are defined (and more may be added) for holding different types of menu items.
;; For example the "major-mode" type opens the menu corresponding to the current major-mode.
;; More different types are defined by one-key extension libraries (e.g. `one-key-dir' for fast directory
;; tree navigation), or you can create your own types. See "Creating menus" below.

;;; The *One-Key* buffer:
;;
;; Running the command `one-key-open-associated-menu-set' or `one-key-open-menu-set' opens the *One-Key* buffer.
;; (these commands may be bound to keys - see "Installation" below).
;;
;; Within the *One-Key* buffer you will see a list of command descriptions each with a corresponding key in square
;; brackets to its left. Pressing the key executes the command.
;; Along the top of the buffer in the header line you will see a list of menu names. One of these names will be
;; highlighted and indicates the current menu. You can navigate between the different menus by pressing the left/right
;; arrow keys (unless these have been redefined to other keys in `one-key-special-keybindings', see below).
;;
;; You can toggle the size of the window holding the *One-Key* buffer by pressing the appropriate special key (see below).
;; The window size is toggled between default size, large size (so that all items fit in the window), and hidden (window
;; is closed, but one-key is still active). This is useful if there are a large number of items in the menu, or when you
;; need to see part of the buffer that is obscured by the *One-Key* window.
;;
;; By default one-key will quit and the *One-Key* window will close after pressing a key corresponding to one of the
;; menu items. If you want one-key to stay active after pressing an item key you should toggle the menu persistence
;; by pressing the appropriate special key (C-menu by default, see "Special keybindings" below).
;; To quit one-key and close the *One-Key* window press ESC. If you want to quit but keep the window open (e.g. to see
;; the keybindings for a major mode), press C-ESC.

;;; Special keybindings:
;;
;; For each different type of menu certain "special" keybindings are defined which activate menu specific commands,
;; such as sorting or editing the menu items, adding new menus, etc.
;; These special keybindings are specific to each menu type, though many of them will be the same for all menu types.
;; For example the arrow keys are defined as special keybindings for navigating around menus.
;;
;; Pressing the f1 key displays a help message listing all the special keybindings for the current menu.
;;
;; By default, when a menu is created one-key will ensure that the keys corresponding to menu items do not clash with
;; the special keybindings for that menu type. However, if for some reason there is a clash then the menu item gets
;; priority over the special keybinding unless the help window is displayed (by pressing f1), in which case the special
;; keybinding gets priority.
;;
;; You can alter or add new special keybindings by customizing `one-key-special-keybindings',
;; and `one-key-default-special-keybindings'.
;; Extension libraries (such as `one-key-dir' or `one-key-regs') may also define customizable special keys specific
;; to the menu type defined in the library.
;;
;; By default the following special keybindings are defined:
;;
;; ESC        : Quit and close menu window                       
;; <C-escape> : Quit, but keep menu window open                  
;; <C-menu>   : Toggle menu persistence                          
;; <menu>     : Toggle menu display                              
;; <left>     : Change to next menu                              
;; <right>    : Change to previous menu                          
;; <up>       : Scroll/move up one line                          
;; <down>     : Scroll/move down one line                        
;; <prior>    : Scroll menu down one page                        
;; <next>     : Scroll menu up one page                          
;; C-h        : Show help for next item chosen                   
;; C-s        : Save current state of menu                       
;; <f1>       : Toggle this help buffer                          
;; <f2>       : Toggle column/row ordering of items              
;; <f3>       : Sort items by next method
;; <C-f3>     : Sort items by previous method          
;; <f4>       : Reverse order of items                 
;; /          : Limit items to those matching regexp   
;; C-/        : Highlight items matching regexp        
;; <f5>       : Edit a menu item

;; <C-f7>     : Yank copied items                      
;; <f8>       : Swap menu item keys                    
;; <f9>       : Add a menu item                        
;; <C-f9>     : Add a menu                             
;; <C-S-f9>   : Remove this menu                       
;; <f10>      : Reposition item (with arrow keys)      
;; <f11>      : Donate to support further development  
;; <C-f11>    : Report a bug                           

;;; Creating menus:
;; 
;; All of the menus are stored in the file `one-key-menus-save-file' (customizable), but you should never need to
;; edit this file. Instead you can create and edit menus from within the *One-Key* buffer.
;; If you press the special key corresponding to "Add a menu" you will be prompted for the type of menu to add.
;; By default the following menu types are defined, but more may be added with extension libraries, or by creating
;; them yourself (see `one-key-types-of-menu'):

;;; Default menu types:
;;
;; top-level         : contains items defined in `one-key-menu-toplevel-alist', which by default contains common prefix key
;;                     menus, and menus for common commands to help new users learn emacs
;; blank menu        : creates a blank menu with no items
;; major-mode        : contains items corresponding to the current major mode (keybindings and menu-bar items)
;; existing menu     : prompts for an existing menu to use
;; existing keymap   : contains items in a given keymap (prompted for)
;; prefix key keymap : contains items whose usual keybindings begin with a given prefix key (prompted for)
;; menu-sets         : contains items for opening menu sets (see below)

;;; Saving menus:

;; If `one-key-autosave-menus' is non-nil then any new menus or menus that have been changed will be saved
;; on Emacs exit, unless they are listed in `one-key-exclude-from-save'
;; Alternatively you may save individual menus by pressing the special key for "Save the current state of menu"
;; (C-s by default).

;;; Menu sets:

;; A menu set is a collection of menu names. When you open the *One-Key* buffer with `one-key-open-associated-menu-set'
;; it opens a collection of menus associated with the current major-mode or buffer. By default this is the set of menus
;; in `one-key-default-menu-set'. You can define other menu sets by customizing `one-key-sets-of-menus-alist', and
;; associate them with different major-modes or buffers by customizing `one-key-associations-for-menu-sets'.
;; Each menu set consists of a name for the menu set, and a list of menu names.
;; one-key reconstructs a menu from its name by searching `one-key-types-of-menu' for a matching entry, and applying
;; the associated function to create the menu.
;; With the "menu-sets" menu you can see what menu sets are currently defined, switch menu sets, and save the current
;; menus as a menu set (C-s).
;; See "Creating menus" above for info on how to add the "menu-sets" menu to the *One-Key* buffer.

;;; Other features:
;;
;; Item help: to get help on a particular menu item press C-h followed by the key for the item. The help page
;; for the associated command will be displayed. If part of the *Help* buffer is obscured by the *One-Key* buffer,
;; you can hide the *One-Key* buffer by pressing the special key to toggle the display (<menu> by default).
;;
;; Item brightening: By default the background colour of a menu item is increased relative to the brightness
;; of other items each time the item is executed. This means you can quickly find the most frequently used items
;; in a large menu. To turn this feature off set `one-key-auto-brighten-used-keys' to nil.
;;
;; Sorting/ordering: you can sort the items in a menu by pressing the appropriate special key, and add new sort
;; methods by customizing `one-key-default-sort-method-alist'. The current sort method is displayed in the mode-line,
;; however this information is not guaranteed to be correct when the *One-Key* menu is initially opened.
;; You can also toggle between row/column ordering of items, and reverse the order of items.
;; By trying out different sort and ordering combinations you can find a configuration which is most readable,
;; or fits most items on screen. The order of menu items is persistent between sessions if the menus are saved
;; (see "Saving menus").
;;
;; Filtering and colouring items: you can filter the items displayed to match a regular expression, or specify
;; the background colour of items that match a given regular expression (press f1 to see which key to press).
;; This can make the menus more readable. The background colours will be saved with the menu.
;;
;; Editing menus: you can add, delete and edit menu items, and also copy or kill (i.e. cut) and yank (i.e. paste)
;; menu items from one menu to another. To copy or kill a bunch of items first make sure they are all highlighted
;; with the same background colour (doesn't matter if they have different brightness levels), and then press the
;; appropriate special key (press f1 for help). You will be prompted for an item in the group, and whether or not
;; you want to also kill (cut) the items from the current menu. The items will be saved in `one-key-copied-items' and
;; can be then be yanked (pasted) into another menu.
;; Any further copy/kills will overwrite the value of `one-key-copied-items', and you cannot retrieve previous kills
;; so take care.
;; You can also reposition items in a menu:
;;    1) press the appropriate specialkey
;;    2) press the key of the item to be moved
;;    3) use the up/down arrow keys to move the item
;;    4) exit one-key to fix the item
;;
;; Support further development: writing this code required a significant amount of unpaid labour on my part.
;; Please consider donating to help support further development by pressing f11 in the *One-Key* menu.
;; To report a bug press C-f11. Please report the circumstances in which the bug occured (where you creating a new
;; menu? what major-mode was in use at the time? etc.).


;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put one-key.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Make sure that you also have hexrgb.el in your load-path.
;; At the time of writing it can be obtained from here: http://emacswiki.org/emacs/hexrgb.el

;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file, replacing <menu> with whatever key you
;; want to use to open the *One-Key* buffer.
;;
;; (require 'one-key)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<menu>") 'one-key-open-associated-menu-set)
;;
;; Because this library uses a special implementation,
;; sometimes a `max-lisp-eval-depth' or `max-specpdl-size' error can occur.
;; So making the above two variables larger will reduce the probability that an error occurs.
;; E.g:
;;
;; (setq max-lisp-eval-depth 10000)
;; (setq max-specpdl-size 10000)
;;

;; New special keybinding for limiting by regexp all items in current menu and all submenus?
;; Make functions autoloadable.
;; Prompt to save submenus when saving menu. Special keybinding to save all altered menus?
;; Autohighlighting of menu items using regexp associations?
;; Add to marmalade and elpa repos.
;; Handle mouse clicks so that item is executed when clicked on, and clicks outside the window close it. Make these customizable.
;; Applications of one-key-read-logical-formula : emms, org-mode header filtering, dired filtering?, gnus?, bbdb?

  "Function to open `one-key' menu of commands. The commands are executed by pressing the associated keys.
If global variable `one-key-popup-window' is t (default) then a menu window will be displayed showing the keybindings.
The argument names to this function are all prefixed with \"okm-\" to distinguish them from other variables since
they are often dynamically bound in other functions.
OKM-MENU-NAMES is the name of the menu as displayed in the menu window, or a list of names corresponding to different menu
lists in OKM-MENU-ALISTS.
OKM-MENU-ALISTS is either a list of menu items, a list of such lists or a symbol whose value is a list or list of lists.
Each item in a menu list is of the form: ((key . description) . command).
If OKM-MENU-ALISTS is a list then OKM-MENU-NUMBER should be an index (starting at 0) indicating which list to display
initially (default is 0), otherwise it should be nil.
The user can switch between the menu lists by pressing the appropriate keys in `one-key-default-special-keybindings'.
If OKM-KEEP-WINDOW-P is non-nil then the menu window will be kept open even after exiting.
If OKM-EXECUTE-WHEN-MISS-MATCH-P is nil then keys not matching menu items or `one-key-default-special-keybindings' will be ignored, otherwise the associated commands in the current keymaps will be executed.
The arguments OKM-MATCH-RECURSION-P and OKM-MISS-MATCH-RECURSION-P indicate whether to execute `one-key-menu' recursively after
a matching or non-matching key are pressed (and corresponding commands executed) respectively.
OKM-PROTECT-FUNCTION, if non-nil, is a function that is called within an `unwind-protect' statement at the end
of `one-key-menu'.
OKM-ALTERNATE-FUNCTION if non-nil is a function that is called after each key press while the menu is active.
If OKM-FILTER-REGEX is non-nil then only menu items whose descriptions match OKM-FILTER-REGEX will be displayed.
If OKM-SPECIAL-KEYBINDING-SYMBOLS is non-nil then it should be a list of symbols corresponding to items in `one-key-special-keybindings', and defines the special keys to use for this menu. Otherwise the special keys will be determined from the menu type,
or `one-key-default-special-keybindings' will be used.
OKM-TITLE-STRING is a string to display above the menu items. If OKM-TITLE-STRING is nil then the title string will be obtained
from the fourth element of the associated menu type in `one-key-types-of-menu' or using `one-key-default-title-func' if that
doesn't exist."

Keys will be assigned to the items using the `one-key-generate-key' function. To exclude certain keys from being used
set INVALIDKEYS to a list of keys (as key-description strings or chars) to be excluded.
These keys will only be excluded from the toplevel menu, not the submenus."

If REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil then the *One-Key* window will not disappear until an item key is pressed or the menu is quit
using the appropriate special key.
If REQUIRE-MATCH is nil then the *One-Key* window will close if a key is pressed which doesn't correspond to a menu item
or a special key, and the value of DEF will be returned.
The optional argument SPECIAL-KEYS is a list of symbols refering to the special keys to use for this menu,
and they must be defined in `one-key-special-keybindings'. You can usually leave the SPECIAL-KEYS argument alone as it uses
sensible defaults."

  "Recursive function for reading trees/recursive lists from the user.
NOTE: This function is called by `one-key-read-tree', `one-key-read-multiple', and `one-key-read-dnf'.
It assumes dynamic binding of okr-title-string which is used by displayfunc to set the title string for the one-key menu.

The PROMPT and COLLECTION arguments are as in `one-key-read'.
MAXDEPTH is the maximum depth allowed for the tree (toplevel has depth 0), and DEPTH is the current depth of the tree.

DISPLAYFUNC should be a function that takes four arguments, choice, depth, maxdepth and tree, where choice is the last item chosen,
depth and maxdepth are the previously mentioned arguments of the same name, and tree is the current subtree. It is called every
time a choice is selected from the one-key menu and should return a value to be added to the tree (the return value of
`one-key-read-tree-1'). It may also make alterations to the dynamically bound variable okr-title-string, a string which is
displayed at the top of the one-key menu.
If the user presses a special key to complete a sublist, start a new sublist, or delete the previous item in the list then the
DISPLAYFUNC function will be called with the choice arg set to the symbol 'goup, 'godown or 'del respectively, and the return
value will not be used. The DISPLAYFUNC function will also be called when a sublist is completed, with the choice arg set to
that list. In this case you may want to make alterations to the sublist before returning it, but not necessarily update the title
string. See `one-key-read-tree-display-func' and `one-key-read-dnf-display-func' for examples."

PROMPT and COLLECTION are as in `one-key-read'.
The optional argument MAXDEPTH is the maximum depth allowed for the tree (toplevel has depth 0).

If ACTIONFUNC is supplied it should be a function that takes three arguments: the currently selected item (a string or a symbol,
see below), the current tree depth, and maxdepth (in that order). The function may perform some actions and should return an item
to be added to the tree. The function is called each time an item is selected/deleted, or when the user goes up/down a level.
For its first argument the function is passed the name of an item when an item is selected, the symbol 'del when an item is deleted,
'goup when the user goes up a level and 'godown when the user goes down a level.
